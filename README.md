# Neural-Mechanical-Linkage
This is a set of Python functions that offers the ability to create 2D mechanical linkages consisting of struts and joints similar to the Strandbeest by Theo Jansen. The scripts allow one to treat the mechanical network of linkages between the struts as a non-linear neural net, which can be optimized to perform different functions.
